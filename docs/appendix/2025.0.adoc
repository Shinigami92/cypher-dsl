=== 2025.0.0

It's about time to create a 2025 major release of Cypher-DSL.
First things first: We removed the deprecated, direct integration of the Neo4j Java driver.
That integration used to allow making all Cypher-DSL statements "executable", that is: You were able to pass a query executor to them and get results back.
It has been used in https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-neo4j[Spring Data Neo4j] testing code, but not much anywhere else.
We removed it because it started to became costly: The common Neo4j Java driver and it's dependency will change a lot in their 6.x series, and especially the dependencies will drag us down.
Cypher-DSL is a project that is used by Spring Data Neo4j, https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-jdbc[Neo4j JDBC Driver] and many more. All of them need to keep an eye on dependency management, hence we prefer to be more lightweight here again.
You won't notice a difference in most use-cases.

With this major we welcome and thank @Shinigami92 as first-time contributor to the ecosystem.
They took inspiration of the Spring Data Neo4j annotation processor and started off a similar processor for https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-ogm[Neo4j-OGM], so that you can now enjoy a static metamodel based on Cypher-DSL for Neo4j-OGM as well.
A usecase might be in a Quarkus application.
