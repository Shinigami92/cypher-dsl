=== 2024.0.0

We're finally going 2024 with this release.
The biggest new feature in this release is that we now allow chaining statements that end with a `YIELD` clause, which lets you compose complex queries in a nicer way.

We also removed all deprecated constructs and methods we accumulated until now. If you ignored the warnings until now, you cannot do any longer. The latest SDN release is prepared for this Cypher-DSL release already, as we did the necessary changes over there already (See this https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-neo4j/commit/2861e771333d8b9443026669763ddccd5be7659d[commit] for the necessary changes for example).
