üéâ The big party release! üéâ

With this release we move the repository from http://github.com/neo4j-contrib/[github.com/neo4j-contrib] to https://github.com/neo4j-contrib[github.com/neo4j] with Neo4j adding Cypher-DSL to the list of supported modules.
What we have now on our todo list is to incorporate our http://neo4j.github.io/cypher-dsl[documentation] into the official Neo4j docs, but apart from that, little will change immediate. Even our Maven coordinates will stay the same. You can however rely on the fact that Cypher-DSL is not going anywhere anytime soon.

Thanks to @stumoore for supporting this!

=== 2024.0.0

We're finally going 2024 with this release.
The biggest new feature in this release is that we now allow chaining statements that end with a `YIELD` clause, which lets you compose complex queries in a nicer way.

We also removed all deprecated constructs and methods we accumulated until now. If you ignored the warnings until now, you cannot do any longer. The latest SDN release is prepared for this Cypher-DSL release already, as we did the necessary changes over there already (See this https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-neo4j/commit/2861e771333d8b9443026669763ddccd5be7659d[commit] for the necessary changes for example).

==== üöÄ Features

* Allow chaining statements to yielding calls. (#964)
* Allow chainable foreach. (#988)

==== üêõ Bug Fixes

* Actually make `sortOrderDefaultExpression` test what it is supposed to test.
