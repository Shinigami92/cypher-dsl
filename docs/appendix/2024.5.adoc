=== 2024.5.0

This new minor release does not have any breaking changes.
A new dialect dubbed 5.26 has been introduced.
When configured, the renderer will prefix all queries with `CYPHER 5`, which is compatible with Neo4j 5.26 as well as the main line 2025.x.
It ensures that a future version of Neo4j will treat all queries generated with Cypher-DSL as Cypher 5, even when newer Cypher versions become available.
