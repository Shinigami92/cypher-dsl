=== 2023.8.0

This minor release is drop-in compatible with 2023.7, but it adds support for using `COLLECT {}` sub-queries, which required enhancing some interfaces (that only we should implement, but still, it's a minor upgrade then).

The price for finding the most bugs in the scoping strategy applied for sub-queries in this release goes to @Andy2003, thank you!
