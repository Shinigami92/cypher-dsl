== 2024.2

=== 2024.2.0

A new minor release so shortly after the last?
We changed the behaviour of the renderer when using generated names.
Before and upto including 2024.1.0 we didn't allow aliases to be reused.
If in the original query alias `x` would have been legally reused, we would not have reused them with generated names, i.e. we would have usd `v0` and then `v1`.
I think this is wrong, and we changed this behaviour, hence a new minor is due.

If you are using generated names, you can opt out of this behaviour like this:

[source,java]
----
var generatedNamesConfig = EnumSet.complementOf(EnumSet.of(Configuration.GeneratedNames.REUSE_ALIASES));
var renderer = Renderer.getRenderer(Configuration.newConfig()
	.withGeneratedNames(generatedNamesConfig)
	.build());
----

Apart from that, this is a drop-in replacement for 2024.1 and 2024.0.

Congratulations to @ali-ince for contributing his first feature.

And last but not least, @Andy2003 gave our AST factory and the scoping mechanism a real good test run, and we have been able to fix several bugs again.
Thank you!
